    <p>Hi there! I’m Akhil M Mathew, a passionate video gamer and aspiring game designer. My love for gaming goes beyond just playing; I’m deeply fascinated by the intricate art and mechanics that make up the world of video games. Designing games is my dream, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to bring immersive and engaging experiences to life.</p>
    <p>When I’m not immersed in a game, you’ll find me sketching out ideas, experimenting with game design software, or diving into the latest industry trends. I’m driven by a desire to create games that captivate players and offer unique experiences, blending storytelling, creativity, and innovative gameplay.</p>
    <p>Let’s connect and talk about games, design, or anything in between!</p>
